                                she can reach her goals.

                    <p class="lead">Based on my findings from the user interviews, I decided to focus on
                        helping guide users through the process of setting actionable
                        goals. Because I focused on using a to-do list as the interface for my
                        observations, I then was faced with the question: How do I
                        differentiate between a tasks and goals? Everybody knows how to
                        create a to-do list, but they didn’t know how to set a system up for
                        long term goals. Thus, I decided to integrate a to-do list into the app
                        because people agree that to-do lists are part of goal setting.
